# Binning_function
This Matlab function is used to bin the data over a specific window and calculate the average value and standard deviation of the mean for each window. 
It is useful for comparing paleoclimate data. For instance, if we want to compare two tempearture records with varying temporal resolutions and from different locations and calculate their temperature difference, this function can help us achive this goal, since it creates two new time seriecs over the same time intervals.
