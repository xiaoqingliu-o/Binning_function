# Binning_function
This Matlab function is used to bin the data over a binning window and obtain the averaged value and standard deviation of the mean for each window. 
It is useful for paleoclimate data comparison. For instance, we want to compare two tempearture records with different temporal resolutions and from different sites and calculate their temperature difference. 
This function can help us achive this goal, since it creates two new times seriecs over the same time intervals.
